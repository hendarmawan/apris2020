Subject: OPEC LOG


OPEC LOG: SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 10TH

THE AGREEMENT

OPEC will complete deliberations on Monday but for all practical purposes
the deal is done. They have agreed to raise allocations by 800 MB/D on a
prorata basis beginning October 1st. The increase is until the next meeting
which will be November 12th in Vienna. This rather early data was chosen
because of the already scheduled Producer/Consumer Dialogue in Saudi Arabia
November 17-19 and the beginning of Ramadan religious observance beginning
November 27th and lasting for approximately one month. The price band and
OPEC output response mechanism (20 consecutive business days above $28/BBL
basket price, increase output 500 MB/D, 10 consecutive days below $22/BBL
basket, decrease 500 MB/D) will remain in effect with obviously a clean
slate to start the price tracking process.

Saudi Arabia pretty much got its way at the meeting, asking for a 1 MMB/D
increase and compromising on 800 MB/D. Of course the increase is prorata
which implies an increase in the Saudi allocation of 260 MB/D, bringing its
total allocation to about 8.5 MMB/D. Saudi crude output is estimated to have
been almost 8.8 MMB/D in August(including 140 MB/D Abu Safa output produced
on behalf of Bahrain). PIRA expects Saudi Arabia's crude output increase to
be on top of its current over-production bringing total output to nearly 9.1
MMB/D. Since with the exception of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, all the OPEC
members are essentially at capacity, the 800 MB/D OPEC allocation increase
should translate into a production increase of only around 400 MB/D. Saudi
Arabia and the UAE have allocations equal to 41.2% of the OPEC total(now
26.2 MMB/D excluding Iraq).  With August/September OPEC crude output at
around 29 MMB/D, fourth quarter crude output will be around 29.5 MMB/D
assuming Iraq at 3.0 MMB/D.

MARKET BACKGROUND

Commercial oil inventories remain quite low with the three major OECD
markets--U.S., Europe and Japan-- ending August with the lowest level in
over 10 years. PIRA would not be surprised to see inventories revised up
somewhat for Europe for the end of the second quarter, but this will not
materially change the likely end August position.

In addition to low inventories, the world is operating with very little
spare producing capacity. With OPEC crude output at 29.5 MMB/D in the fourth
quarter, there will only be some 0.5 to 1.0 MMB/D of instant spare producing
capacity remaining. This number will certainly increase in time, but for at
least the first half of the fourth quarter there is not much room for any
interruption in expected supply for any reason (hurricanes, Iraq saber
rattling, earthquakes, etc).

Also, the lead seasonal product distillate(gasoil/diesel) is in great shape
and with substantial refining margins there is plenty of headroom for crude.
Add to the mix very low PADD II crude stocks, positive technicals and
seasonals, at most only ten million barrels of current net speculative
length in the NYMEX crude contract and continued strong economic growth and
you have rather impressive positives for price.

SHORT TERM MARKET BALANCES & PRICES

With fourth quarter OPEC crude output at 29.5 MMB/D, world onshore oil
inventories should draw only 100-200 MB/D in the quarter. Thus assuming
normal early winter weather, stocks will remain very low but not, on
average, decline significantly. For the three major OECD markets, commercial
inventories should end the year 1-2% above the year earlier.

In these circumstances and given the very positive market factors noted
above, it is hard to see oil prices taking a big hit downward as a result of
the OPEC agreement. PIRA would expect the very initial market reaction to be
negative given that the agreed increase is somewhat more than anticipated.
The market will then probably consolidate given that there is a good deal of
confusion about the impact of the agreement. Given the current very strong
fundamentals an upward price bias is likely to quickly return. However, one
major wildcard negative for price first needs to be sorted out.

THE POTENTIAL U.S. SPR SWAP

If the United States is going to use the SPR to swap current barrels from
the strategic reserve to be replaced in the future, the market will find out
this week. With the U.S. Presidential election on November 7th, October
pipeline scheduling completion on September 25th and probably ten days to
carry out an auction, this is the last window of opportunity to have a
meaningful impact before the onset of winter and the election. With SPR
barrels being short haul, as opposed to 45 days away for any incremental
OPEC oil, its impact on oil prices would be far greater than OPEC's current
agreement. Moreover, if the decision is made to use the reserve in this
fashion, the Secretary of Energy is likely to decide to make sure it has the
desired impact of bringing prices down substantially by offering to swap
very substantial volumes. PIRA rates the odds of a swap at 55%.

With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at 
(713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at 
(713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to 
iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?
For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <

When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of
John, do you truly love me more than these?'
'Yes Lord,' he said, 'you know that I love you.'
Jesus said, 'Feed my lambs.'...
Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, 'Do you love me?' He
said, 'Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.'
John 21:15,  17b (NIV)

Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved him. The first time Jesus said,
"Do you truly love (Greek agape: volitional, self-sacrificial love) me more
than these?" The second time, Jesus focused on Peter alone and still used
the word translated into Greek, phileo (signifying affection, affinity, or
brotherly love) and asked, in effect, "Are you even my friend?" Each time
Peter responded with the word translated into Greek as phileo. Jesus doesn't
settle for quick, superficial answers. He has a way of getting to the heart
of the matter. Peter had to face his true feelings and motives when Jesus
confronted him. How would you respond if Jesus asked you, "Do you truly love
me?" Do you really love Jesus? Are you even his friend?

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

This past weekend was the MS 150 bike tour from Houston to Austin.  This was 
my third year riding in the event, and it keeps getting better every year.  

We started out bright and early on Saturday morning with some 9,500 other 
riders eager to make the 175 mile trip to Austin.  Team Enron was first out 
of the gate again this year.  The course was more congested than last year 
because of the huge increase in ridership.  The event has been growing 20 
percent each year.  The crowd started to thin out after about 15 miles, and 
it was smooth sailing until lunch in Bellville.  After a quick sandwich, I 
was on my way again to LaGrange.  There were a few more hills this year than 
last, and the wind started to pick up towards the end.  Visions of a cold 
Miller Lite and a relaxing message inspired me onward.  I arrived in LaGrange 
about 1:15, plenty of time to shower and relax in the tent before Enron's 
famous barbecue dinner.

The next morning, we awoke bright and early to the call to the MS Society's 
pancake breakfast.  Getting up at 5am and back on your bike after having 
ridden 100 miles the previous day was no fun task, but everything was fine 
after about 10 miles.  Sunday morning was fairly uneventful until the 
infamous Bastrop State Park with its killer hills.  After the park was lunch, 
then the homestretch to Austin.  This year we had a nice tailwind to help us 
along.    

Last year, with the support of people like you, the Texas MS society raised 
over $3.5 million for multiple sclerosis research.  This year, we will 
certainly break through that goal. Each of us probably know at least one 
person touched by this terrible disease, and this money goes a long way 
towards finding a cure.  

If I haven't already collected your pledge, I'd appreciate it if you'd drop 
it by.  For those of you not on 45, I'll stop by your floor sometime next 
week.  Thank you for your support!  


Brian

Again Jesus said, 'Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am
sending you.'
John 20:21 (NIV)

Jesus again identified himself with his Father. He told the disciples by
whose authority he did his work. Then he passed the job to his disciples of
spreading the gospel of salvation around the world. Whatever God has asked
you to do, remember: (1) your authority comes from God, and (2) Jesus has
demonstrated by words and actions how to accomplish the job he has given
you. As the Father sent Jesus, Jesus sends his followers...and you.

Subject: New Reports from PIRA


To PIRA's Retainer Service Clients,
Attached are two strategic reports on the telecom industry that address the
burgeoning market for bandwidth and the implications for the energy
industry.
The first report, "BROADBAND OR DEADBAND: An Appraisal of the Fledgling
Bandwidth Commodity Market," focuses on trading in the wholesale broadband
market.  To assist readers in navigating this report (as well as the second
report) a short glossary of terms can be found in its Appendix.
The second report, "THE DASH FOR CASH: Lucrative Opportunities to Provide
High-Speed Internet Access," focuses on the means by which consumers will
access this communications capacity and some strategic opportunities for
energy companies.
We hope you find these reports useful and strategically provocative.  After
investing great effort in becoming conversant in this area, it is clear to
us at PIRA that the energy marketplace will be forever changed by the demand
for, and creation of, substantial broadband.  What is NOT clear to us at
this time is how we can best assist our clients that are looking to
participate in these developments.  In light of that, we ask that you take a
moment to complete the brief survey that is also attached to this email.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Dr. Gary N. Ross
Chief Executive Officer

Subject: fwd

sounds like a good idea.... id like to know where the author of this lives,  
however, cause its more like $2.00 a gallon here in san diego....  and  
besides, it really is fairly cheap compared to european countries because 
our  
govt subsidizes the entire automobile industry... gas, cars, roadways etc.   
realistically, you should be paying way more than what you currently do.   
maybe its time to start thinking more into alternative sources of  
transportation other that the individual automobile... i can go on with this  
subject regarding all the various societal impacts but i'll cut myself off  
there.  food for thought... 
By now you're probably thinking gasoline priced at about $1.49 is cheap. Me  
too! As it is now $1.58 for regular unleaded.  Now that the oil companies 
and  
the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a gallon of  
gas is CHEAP at less than $1.50, we need to try an aggressive response.  
With  
the price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to take  
action. The only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we  
don't buy it.  But, that's not really a practical option since we all have  
come to rely on our cars.  But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all  
act together. 
Here's the idea - 
For the rest of this year, don't purchase gasoline from the two biggest  
companies (which now are one), EXXON and MOBIL. If they are not selling, 
they  
should be inclined to reduce their prices-and if they reduce their prices 
the  
other companies will too.  But to have an impact, we need to reach literally  
millions of users. 
But it's doable!  I am sending this note to 42 people. If each of you send 
it  
to at least 10 more ... and those 10 send it to at least 10 more and so on 
by  
the time the message reaches the sixth iteration we will have reached over  
one million consumers. Acting together we can make a difference. If this  
makes sense to you, please pass this message on, or one you compose, to at  
least 10 more E-mail addresses. 
**** PLEASE HOLD OUT UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO BELOW $1.28 
-- $1.29 AND KEEP THEM DOWN. THIS CAN REALLY WORK. 
If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention! Message-ID: <20643061.1075857944461.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

 -----Original Message-----
From:  Burk, Bart  
Sent: Wednesday, May 02, 2001 12:33 PM

Subject: The Price Anderson Act - Nuclear Power

I called the Nuclear Information and Resource Service in D.C. and spoke to a 
representative. He mentioned that the Price Anderson Act has brought about 
opposition in the past, but has typically breezed through the renewal 
process. The NIRS website seemed to more anti-nuclear power focused, so it 
was interesting that he did not see the Act as having any trouble in its 
renewal.

My perspective is that nuclear power accounted for about 20% of all power 
generation last year, and would cause rolling black-outs if ceased. Politics 
and recent surveys of the positive turn in public opinion suggests that it 
would be highly unlikely for nuclear power to be phased out. Nuclear plants 
nearing the end of their initial useful life period - around 30 years - have 
already begun an extension process. Five reactors have been licensed for 
another 20 years of operation. The WSJ article stated that within the next 15 
years, 40% of the 103 licensed U.S. reactors are likely to request similar 
extensions.

Independents are buying-up the plants from utilities and taking advantage of 
high power prices and low nuclear fuel costs. The new technologies mentioned 
in the article suggest that an overrun of construction permits may be filed 
in the near future. Smaller megawatt units operate at lower temperatures, and 
are thus less susceptible to catastrophic failure if their cooling systems 
are crippled. Investment costs are modest, construction times are faster, 
power could be supplied in a shorter period of time, and the NRC has improved 
the time for the approval process. Companies could re-coup their costs and 
make decent profits within a short period, even if there were fears of 
negative opposition down the road.

A negative outcome for the Price Anderson Act renewal could slow plans to 
build new nuclear plants, but it is likely that existing plants will continue 
to operate. At a minimum, base load nuclear power generation should be flat 
over the next couple of years.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Lon,

I added sensitivity of the ostrip premium to the basis offset (output 10)
for the forward start options in OSTRIP2 model

I added forward vega (7) gas daily vega (8) and Charm (9) previously
for Larry May.


Please find the example spreadsheet and Exotica add-in.   (you need to
delink your Exotica addin and Browse to select the new addin).
After you test it, we can put into the release version.   Use the attached 
addin
as the temporary one.

Let me know your comments.

Zimin

Subject: A Two States Model For Power

One of my GARP connections at El Paso has put forth a white paper for 
discussion. He is hoping it will be adopted across the industry.  He will be 
presenting it June 5th, at the next GARP meeting in Houston, to be hosted by 
El Paso at El Paso.  He is collecting feedback before the upcoming meeting.  
Please review, and comment to either myself of Lloyd at the address below.  


Thanks,

Dear AMU Student:

Thank you registering for classes at AMU.  This e-mail is your
confirmation that we have received your registration and that you are
enrolled in one or more courses.  We wish you the best of luck in your
class.

To ensure that you are properly prepared for your course, there are three
(3) more quick things you need to do:

Step 1: If Eligible, Get Tuition Assistance

If you have not already done so, you will need to go to your Education
Center or Human Resource Office to get completed Tuition Assistance (TA)
paperwork.   In order for your TA paperwork to be completed by your ESO or
HR professional and accepted by AMU, the following information must be
correct:

- Course Number and Title

- Course Start and End dates

- The amount per credit hour ($250 per semester hour).

Please know that Tuition Assistance Regulations require that we not
provide access to the Student Course Guide until the AMU Financial Aid
Office has received your completed TA paperwork.  TA paperwork may be
faxed to 703-330-5109 and is required before the start date of the
semester.  If you encounter any problems with your TA paperwork please
immediately send an e-mail to hstine@amunet.edu or call (703) 330 - 5398
ext 117.

Step 2: Order Your Books

In order to provide the best possible customer service and to allow
students to track the status of their book shipments, AMU changed its book
ordering process effective April 9, 2001.  It is now requested that
student contact MSB directly to order books.

Undergraduate Students participating in the AMU Book Grant*, need to order
books as soon as possible by calling MBS after registering for their
classes.   Ordering is easy:

Call 1-800-325-3252

Give Customer Service your name, and the AMU course(s) you=01,re taking.

Step 3.   Tell MBS what address to ship your books to - and you=01,re done.

After MBS has confirmed your book order, you will be issued a UPS tracking
number that you can use to check to the status of your book(s).  If you
encounter any problems with your book shipment, or if your book(s) do not
arrive, you will need to contact MBS at the number listed above (please
note that APO/FPO shipping times generally take longer than regular CONUS
mail so please order your books as soon possible).

MBS can be reached toll free 1-800-325-3252 during the following hours
(Central Time):

Monday - Thursday 7 am - 10 PM

Friday 7 am - 6 PM

Saturday 8 am  - 5 PM

Sunday  12pm - 4 PM

All foreign or APO/FPO students may want to use the MBS commercial number
which is (573) 441-9179.

Graduate students are required to purchase their books.  You may order
books from our preferred provider, MBS Direct,  by going to
http://direct.mbsbooks.com/amu.htm.  If you order your books on-line, MBS
discounts the UPS shipping charges by 20%.  You can also call MBS
toll-free at: 800-325-3252.  For more information on shipping charges to
foreign addresses, you can contact MBS at 573-446-5299.  Please know that
the standard shipping time for books is 5 business days so please remember
to order your books as soon as possible before the start of your class.

Step 3: Maintain Your Student ID and Password

Your Student ID and password are your keys to access the Electronic
Classroom.  If you have do not remember or if you have lost your Student
ID and password, please immediately send an e-mail to
techsupport@amunet.edu.

Complete these 3 steps and you'll be on your way to success.  If you have
any questions or need any assistance, please contact the registrar at
(703) 330-5398 ext 104.

Best of luck to you in your courses!

Sincerely,

AMU Office of Student Services & Technology

* if you were a student prior to February 1999, and were allowed to
continue under the old tuition rate, you must still purchase your own book
either through MBS or another book vendor as the AMU Book Grant will not
cover the cost your books.Message-ID: <6542503.1075857941210.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

So the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord!'  But [Thomas]
said to them, 'Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger
where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe
it.'....
Then [Jesus] said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out
your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.'" Thomas said
to him, 'My Lord and my God!'"
John 20:25, 27-28 (NIV)

Jesus wasn't hard on Thomas for his doubts. Despite his skepticism, Thomas
was still loyal to the believers and to Jesus himself. Some people need to
doubt before they believe. If doubt leads to questions, questions lead to
answers, and the answers are accepted, then doubt has done good work. It is
when doubt becomes stubbornness and stubbornness becomes a life-style that
doubt harms faith. When you doubt, don't stop there. Let your doubt deepen
your faith as you continue to search for the answer.Message-ID: <8541268.1075857942335.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

I have done a crappy job of being a witness and a friend.  You are correct,
and rightly so about the way I have patronized you.  It has not been a
conscious effort, but I understand your perspective and as I look at me, I
am forced to admit you are correct.  Christian hypocrites are a dime a
dozen, and I am ashamed that I have fallen far short of what He has called
me to be.

I am very thankful for your business over that last 3 years.  I know that my
success here has been largely because of your help and business and I and my
family thank you for it.

I have taken your name off the Daily Word distribution list as you have
requested.  My best to you and your family and your success in business.  It
is my hope that I can be a better friend, witness and more to you again.

Thanks for

Todd Gross

Subject: Houston Ballet's Miller Theater Performance of Coppelia


Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the 777 Clay garage are being offered a 
parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.Message-ID: <24644472.1075857942647.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

VCM is not an eligible swap counterparty.  Until established, we could 
possibly face FERC audit if we opened them up prematurly.  We consider the 
issue a high priority and will let you know when the guaranty comes in.

Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole
heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His
kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey
him.'

Daniel 7:27 (NIV)

Come, Thou Almighty King,
Help us Thy name to sing.
Help us to praise:
Father all glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of Days.
"Come, Thou Almighty King" Italian Hymn (c. 1757)

Lord God, we yearn for the day when You will reign.... but we are not
alone. You are with us, beside us, above us, beneath us and within us. We
trust You to see us through to the other side of this troubled time. Stir up
Your Holy Spirit in us so that we can be peacemakers in the midst of
conflict, and sow a harvest of righteousness.Message-ID: <21628167.1075857941856.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Effective 5/1/01 through 10/31/01 we have a 10,000 MMBtu/d index put at 
Dominion South Point to PSEG.  We can do as much as we want in any month, 
within the 0-10,000 MMBtu/d parameters, but we can do no more than 920,000 
MMBtu for the whole term.  We need to keep a running tally of how much we 
use.  Starting on Monday, can we keep this tally on the morning sheet and 
update it daily?

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.Message-ID: <17787711.1075857941835.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline=
=20
website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessar=
y=20
to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached=
=20
file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below i=
s=20
the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut k=
ey=20
that is mapped to the same function:



1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change fr=
om=20
a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a=
=20
specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic=20
price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and=
 a=20
suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the=
=20
mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend functi=
on=20
to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered. =20
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended on=
ce=20
a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be=
=20
available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.

Thank You,

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

On April 23rd, Enron Houston employees will be invited to celebrate the Topping-Out of Enron Center South. This exciting day will be a celebration for all Enron employees, our contractors and construction crew and for the city of Houston.

Hi Larry,
 
Just wanted to write you a quick note to let you know that John Daly asked me to come back for an interview with Cinergy's VP of Trading and Origination, Bruce Sukaly.  Whoo hoo!  =)  Thank you again for giving John your recommendation last week.  I'll keep you posted.
 
Best,
Sheila  Chang

Larry:
Hope all is ok with your current situation.  I hope you know you can take a=
ny time off necessary to deal with the matter. =20
=20
Congrats on the great deal Monday and I appreciate the heads up before tran=
sacting that size deal.
=20
I'm sorry you missed the mtg monday afternoon.  I want to sum up what my th=
oughts are and what I've learned over the past couple days.  First of all, =
I'm very disappointed in some of the current but mostly former employees of=
 this company.  I think we, in gas trading, have made great efforts to crea=
te a very strong and profitable franchise without ever compromising our int=
egrity.=20
While I do not believe any fraud nor illegal activity has occurred, I do be=
lieve Enron pushed the gray area more than was necessary in some of these d=
ealings.  And while I don't believe Fastow acted unethically or inappropria=
tely in these dealings (and I may be wrong), I do think the presence of a c=
onflict of interest and the appearance of impropriety should have precluded=
 him from these entering into these transactions.  There is a reason why En=
ron employees are not allowed to trade energy commodities for their own acc=
ount.  It is not because Enron does not trust its employees to do the right=
 thing; it is an effort to prevent even the slightest allegation that an em=
ployee's first and foremost responsibility is not to the company.  That is =
where, in my opinion, Fastow errored. =20
I think employee morale has been damaged for 3 reasons over the past year. =
 First, we are tired of bad business deals: India, South American assets, A=
zurix, broadband, etc.  Second, over this period of poor business judgment,=
 some of the same individuals who made these decisions were very well compe=
nsated.  Third, I think there is a concern about the integrity of the organ=
ization and the top managers.  Rather than worry about the past, I prefer t=
o look at the organization going forward.  The truth about the LJM matter w=
ill be brought forward through one or more of the following : legal courtro=
om, SEC investigation, internal Enron investigation, court of public opinio=
n, court of Enron employees' opinion, and investigative journalism.  If any=
 officers of the company acted inappropriately at any time, I can almost gu=
arantee they will not have a future at this company.  I say that because I =
do believe in the current management.  The question you, as well as other e=
mployees need to be asking themselves, is twofold.  First, will the current=
 problems affect the organization's abililty to conduct business in the fut=
ure?  And second, has the culture of the organization changed over the past=
 several years whereby these probems will not happen again?   As long as we=
 can maintain our credit rating, which I believe we can, I believe this wil=
l have minimal effect to the trading business and little effect on Enron's =
business.  Our desire to conserve capital at this point to shore up the bal=
ance sheet means we won't be buying any hundred million dollar+ assets in t=
he near future, which is probably a good thing.  The second question is jus=
t as important.  I will tell you honestly that had the management of this c=
ompany of 2 years ago be in place today, I would not currently be an employ=
ee here.  Over the past couple years, the management turnover has been extr=
emely beneficial.  Gone are  Pai, Hannon, Rice, Skilling, Sutton, etc. that=
 had, with the exception of Skilling, limited intellectual ability, integri=
ty, and drive.  The new management of Whalley, Lavorato, Sheriff, Fallon, a=
nd Delainey, in my opinion, is one of the most capable management teams in =
business today.  These are people that will make the right business decisio=
ns and are not afraid to act as individuals.  I do believe in this team and=
, so long Enron treats the trading organization well at the end of the year=
 which I have no reason to believe otherwise, intend to continue our missio=
n to create the most dominant energy trading franchise around. =20
We all want to yell at someone for the debacle that has been created.  Unfo=
rtunatley, most of those people arent at the company anymore.  I do encoura=
ge you to go to the employee mtg tomorrow regardless of market conditions. =
 Enron values and needs your contributions, and thus it is important to me =
that you are comfortable with the organization going forward.  I think it i=
s benficial to hear Enron's side of the story as well as what we read in th=
e paper. =20

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.Message-ID: <9753244.1075845252001.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Please respond to 
So the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord!'  But [Thomas]
said to them, 'Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger
where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe
it.'....
Then [Jesus] said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out
your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.'" Thomas said
to him, 'My Lord and my God!'"
John 20:25, 27-28 (NIV)

Jesus wasn't hard on Thomas for his doubts. Despite his skepticism, Thomas
was still loyal to the believers and to Jesus himself. Some people need to
doubt before they believe. If doubt leads to questions, questions lead to
answers, and the answers are accepted, then doubt has done good work. It is
when doubt becomes stubbornness and stubbornness becomes a life-style that
doubt harms faith. When you doubt, don't stop there. Let your doubt deepen
your faith as you continue to search for the answer.Message-ID: <24240589.1075841200534.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Hi,

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

>
>8:00 am:  I arrive at the World Trade Center complex.  Stop off at the bank
>in the tunnels below Two World Trade Center to make a deposit at the ATM.
>
>
>
>8:15 am:  I arrive at the 85th floor of One WTC, where my company, SMW
>Trading, has its offices.  I begin preparing reports for another day of
>trading at the NYMEX, located in a separate building 5 minutes away from
>the
>office.
>
>
>
>8:43am:  I am sitting at the table in the center of the office, my back
>facing the outside windows.  Suddenly, a horrific explosion.  An immediate
>change in the air pressure.  A ghostly column of air shoots like a canon
>into the office.  The front door slams shut.  Papers are whipped into the
>air.  I'm thrown off my chair and to the ground.  My boss jumps out of his
>office a second prior to the explosion.  He had watched, in horrific
>disbelief, the entire event as the plane narrowly missed the empire state
>building and set a direct course for our building.  The explosion sends the
>tower shaking furiously, lurching back and forth with sickening vengeance
>for maybe five or ten seconds.  I think we may die.  The building may
>topple
>over, or crumble.  Finally it stops.  The building is still standing.
>Everybody stares at each other, no idea of what happened or what to say.
>Speculations about an explosion, a bomb.  No, it was a plane, our boss
>says.
>A commercial jet.
>
>
>
>[Losing track of time]:  I immediately walk to the door.  Someone screams
>not to open the door; the hallway is on fire.  Curious, Rob "Opie" Leder
>and
>I touch the door and the handle.  It's cool.  I open the door, slowly,
>cautiously, to see what's out there.  It's pitch black out there, except
>for
>the office light, still on, shining off of the billowing smoke in the hall.
>The smell is horrible.  This is no ordinary smoke.  It smells of metal, jet
>fuel, of rancid concrete, of things unspeakable.  I close the door.  People
>are still numb, shocked, confused.  Opie was the first to say it; he was
>getting the hell outta there.  I'm with you man.  I open the door again.
>The smoke is thinner.  I see an orange glow outside the door, a fire
>smoldering around the corner.    I hear guys in another office yelling for
>help or something, too scared to open their door.  Nobody knows where the
>stairs are, not even them.
>
>
>
>Back into the office, to grab some stuff.  The black SMW jacket I wear to
>the trading floor.  It's full of pick cards, order tickets, my empty water
>bottle, Ice gum, a calculator, a pen, a halls cough drop, and trading
>analyzers.  I put on my jacket.  I decide to fill up my water bottle.  Opie
>waits for me, ready to bolt.  Almost everybody wants to leave now.
>
>
>
>Marvin Pickrum.  Where is he?  When did he leave?  Where did he go?  Is he
>in the bathroom?  The bathroom!  Someone check the bathroom.  I walk into
>the hallway, inhaling the noxious stench, and I walk down the hall.  To the
>left, another hallway, three small fires burning, debris everywhere, lights
>out.  In front of me, another office, another man peering out, more
>terrified people.  To the right, another hallway, the bathroom, and the
>stairwell.  I open the bathroom door, everything in pristine condition.
>Like nothing happened. I call out for Marvin, no answer.  He's not in the
>bathroom.  We head down the stairs.
>
>
>
>We move fast.  Not a lot of people in the stairs yet.  At 81, Opie stops to
>help some guy break out some fire extinguishers.  We each grab an
>extinguisher.  We get to 72.  People are coming back up the stairs.  What's
>the problem?  The door several platforms down is pinned shut.  People come
>back upstairs from below.  We walk out into the hall to find another
>stairwell.  This floor had damage.  Wires and debris everywhere.  A wall
>blown down into the hallway.  Some fires smoldering in the rubble.  I cover
>my face and try not to look.  Afraid of another explosion.  We find another
>stairwell at the other end of the hall.
>
>
>
>In the next stairwell, there are more people.  The descent gets slower.  We
>try to use Opie's cell phone.  It was impossible to get a connection; an
>occasional faint ring, then everything goes dead.  The display read
>"service
>unavailable at this time."  What, try again later?
>
>
>
>At about 65, still trying to use the cell phone.  Service still down.  We
>stop on a large platform.  I notice a woman rocking back and forth directly
>behind me.  She was barefoot, holding her shoes.  She asks me for a swig of
>water, and uses it to wet her shirt and cover her mouth against the
>sickening stench.  She anxiously, nervously tells me that she has two
>children, and she has to get downstairs.  We start moving again.  She picks
>her way down quickly, passing people where she can.  She makes good
>progress.  She's polite.  She's frantic.
>
>
>
>At 60, cell phones still not working.  I toss the investor's business daily
>I've been carrying with me.  Not exactly important stuff at the moment.  I
>think to myself that I'm trashing the building, and I feel bad.
>
>
>
>At 50, cell phone service still out.  A man with blood covering half of his
>face and a bandage on his head walking down the stairs.  Others pass with
>him, obviously in pain.  People move to the right and let them pass.
>Everybody is calm, orderly, supportive.  Nobody takes advantage of the path
>they clear.  Such calm, such unselfishness in the face of tragedy.  Quiet
>adrenalin.  Rumors of a second plane.   People are making jokes to ease the
>strain.
>
>
>
>We carry the fire extinguishers all the way down to the 49th floor.  I'm
>sweating like crazy, shirt untucked, unbuttoned, I'm wearing my jacket,
>still carrying the fire extinguisher.
>
>
>
>At 45, cell phones still not working.  I see a firefighter heading up the
>stairs.  A reassuring presence, giving words of encouragement.  At 35, more
>firefighters, serious equipment in their hands, on their backs.  At 30, the
>door to that floor is open, firefighters have set up base camp, they've
>dropped their stuff, tended to some injured people.  They've secured all
>the
>floors below them.  They're working their way up, trying to save the people
>above us.  At 25, a man with a cane struggles down the stairs, another man
>is helping him down.  After we pass these men, things start moving.  Maybe
>he was the bottleneck.  We stop less frequently now.
>
>
>
>At 20, a woman, Juliette, is struggling to get down, tired and out of
>breath.  We offer water and help, she accepts.  We wait a few seconds for
>her to rest.  Opie takes her purse, which is heavy, and her jacket.  Opie
>walks in front of her, I walk behind.  We tell people to pass us on our
>left.
>
>
>
>Floor 15, then 10, and then 5.  At 2, some light.  Outside light.  Close to
>home free.  We finally exit the stairwell, into the lobby, street level,
>facing east, and facing a courtyard I don't really recognize.  It must be
>in
>the middle of the World Trade Center complex.  In the courtyard I recognize
>colors.  Green from a small tree, gray from buildings.  Blue sky,
>somewhere.
>Black, too.  Black stuff on the green, and black stuff on the ground, small
>puffs of smoke.  It must be debris from wreckage.  What looks like a
>person's leg.  I can't focus, my mind is wandering.  I don't want to look.
>
>
>
>Firefighters lead us to the escalators.  They don't work, there's debris on
>them that we climb over.  We go down slowly.  A few people complain we're
>walking too slowly.  What if you needed help? I ask.  That keeps them
>quiet.
>
>We get down to the lower level, to the glass doors separating One World
>Trade Center from the shops underground.  The glass is all blasted out.
>Firefighters are showing us the way out, through the doors.  An eerie

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

This message is to inform you that information contained on your printed pay advice for the pay period ending May 31, 2001, may be misleading.

Regardless of whether you have single or multiple direct deposits, your net pay is correct, but your pay advice will indicate that all of your pay has been deposited collectively to "Other Bank".  It does not list specific bank accounts.  However, if you view your pay advice in eHRonline, you will be able to confirm your scheduled direct deposits and verify the accounts to which the deposits were made.  

You may access eHRonline and view your pay advice by taking the following steps:

?	Click the following link to open eHRonline:  https://ehronline.enron.com 
?	Read the disclaimer
?	Click Accept
?	Type your SAP Logon ID (e.g. your "P" ID) in the User Id field.
?	Enter your SAP password in the Password field.
?	Click the Logon button.
?	Select Paycheck Inquiry from the drop-down list
?	Click the radio button next to Results in Period to select the default for the May 31, 2001 pay advice
?	Click the Continue button.
?	Click the link for the 05/16/2001-05/31/2001 pay period to display your pay advice.
?	Scroll to the bottom of the screen to view your direct deposit details.

If you have additional questions about your pay advice or accessing eHRonline, please contact the ISC Customer Care Group at 713.345.4727 or isc.hotline@enron.com .

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.Message-ID: <22544107.1075861849958.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.Message-ID: <4548652.1075841193691.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated. Message-ID: <27115611.1075845251450.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Subject:	The Price Anderson Act - Nuclear Power

I called the Nuclear Information and Resource Service in D.C. and spoke to a representative. He mentioned that the Price Anderson Act has brought about opposition in the past, but has typically breezed through the renewal process. The NIRS website seemed to more anti-nuclear power focused, so it was interesting that he did not see the Act as having any trouble in its renewal.

My perspective is that nuclear power accounted for about 20% of all power generation last year, and would cause rolling black-outs if ceased. Politics and recent surveys of the positive turn in public opinion suggests that it would be highly unlikely for nuclear power to be phased out. Nuclear plants nearing the end of their initial useful life period - around 30 years - have already begun an extension process. Five reactors have been licensed for another 20 years of operation. The WSJ article stated that within the next 15 years, 40% of the 103 licensed U.S. reactors are likely to request similar extensions.

Independents are buying-up the plants from utilities and taking advantage of high power prices and low nuclear fuel costs. The new technologies mentioned in the article suggest that an overrun of construction permits may be filed in the near future. Smaller megawatt units operate at lower temperatures, and are thus less susceptible to catastrophic failure if their cooling systems are crippled. Investment costs are modest, construction times are faster, power could be supplied in a shorter period of time, and the NRC has improved the time for the approval process. Companies could re-coup their costs and make decent profits within a short period, even if there were fears of negative opposition down the road.

A negative outcome for the Price Anderson Act renewal could slow plans to build new nuclear plants, but it is likely that existing plants will continue to operate. At a minimum, base load nuclear power generation should be flat over the next couple of years.

Who did it?     Foreign Report presents an alternative view 

Israel's military intelligence service, Aman, suspects that Iraq is the 
state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the New York Trade Center and 
the Pentagon in Washington. Directing the mission, Aman officers believe, 
were two of the world's foremost terrorist masterminds: the Lebanese Imad 
Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah, and the 
Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible 
successor of the ailing Osama Bin Laden. 

The two men have not been seen for some time. Mughniyeh is probably the 
world's most wanted outlaw. Unconfirmed reports in Beirut say he has 
undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable. Zawahiri is thought to be 
based in Egypt. He could be Bin Laden's chief representative outside 
Afghanistan. 

The Iraqis, who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty 
work, were quick to discover the advantages of Al-Qaeda. The Israeli sources

claim that for the past two years Iraqi intelligence officers were shuttling

between Baghdad and Afghanistan, meeting with Ayman Al Zawahiri. According 
to the sources, one of the Iraqi intelligence officers, Salah Suleiman, was 
captured last October by the Pakistanis near the border with Afghanistan. 
The Iraqis are also reported to have established strong ties with Imad 
Mughniyeh. 

"We've only got scraps of information, not the full picture," admits one 
intelligence source, "but it was good enough for us to send a warning six 
weeks ago to our allies that an unprecedented massive terror attack was 
expected. One of our indications suggested that Imad Mughniyeh met with some

of his dormant agents on secret trips to Germany. We believe that the 
operational brains behind the New-York attack were Mughniyeh and Zawahiri, 
who were probably financed and got some logistical support from the Iraqi 
Intelligence Service (SSO)." 

Mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before. On April 12th 
1997, he was reported to be only two hours away from achieving the highest 
goal of any terrorist organisation (until last week): blowing up an Israeli 
El-Al airliner above Tel Aviv. A man carrying a forged British passport with

the name Andrew Jonathan Neumann was in a Jerusalem hotel preparing a bomb 
he was supposed to take on board an El-Al flight leaving Israel, when it 
accidentally went off. Andrew Jonathan Neumann was very badly injured but 
strong enough to reveal later to the Israelis that he was not British but 
Lebanese, and that his operation was supposed to be a special "gift" to 
Israel from Imad Mughniyeh. 

'A psychopath' 

"Bin Laden is a schoolboy in comparison with Mughniyeh," says an Israeli who

knows Mughniyeh . "The guy is a genius, someone who refined the art of 
terrorism to its utmost level. We studied him and reached the conclusion 
that he is a clinical psychopath motivated by uncontrollable psychological 
reasons, which we have given up trying to understand. The killing of his two

brothers by the Americans only inflamed his strong motivation." 

Experts on Iraq and Saddam Hussein also believe that Iraq was the state 
behind the two terror masterminds. "In recent months, there was a change, 
and Iraq decided to get into the terror business. On July 7th, they tried 
for the first time to send a suicide bomber, trained in Baghdad, to blow up 
Tel Aviv airport (Foreign Report No. 2651)." 

Our sources believe that it will be very difficult to get to the bottom of 
this unprecedented terror operation. However, they believe the chief of the 
Iraqi SSO is Qusai Hussein, the dictator's son, and his organisation is the 
most likely to have been involved. 

Mughniyeh, 48, is a "sick man", says an intelligence officer who was in 
charge of his file. He is considered by Western intelligence agencies as the

most dangerous active terrorist today. He is wanted by several governments 
and the Americans have put a $2m reward on his head. 

[Detailed list of Mughniyeh operations removed for Non-Subscriber Extract] 

It was the assassination of one man in March 1984 that is said to have made 
Mughniyeh the CIA's most wanted terrorist. Mughniyeh allegedly kidnapped the

head of the CIA station in Beirut, William Buckley. The kidnapping triggered

what later became known as 'Irangate', when the Americans tried to exchange 
Buckley (and others) with arms for Iran. However, the attempt ended in a 
fiasco. By one unconfirmed account, Mughniyeh tortured and killed Buckley 
with his own hands. 

A year later, in a combined CIA/Mossad operation, a powerful car bomb went 
off at the entrance to the house of Hizbullah's spiritual leader, Sheikh 
Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah. Seventy-five people were killed. One of them was

his brother. Hunted by the CIA and the Mossad, Mughniyeh hid in Iran. 

In February 1992, Israeli helicopter gunships attacked the convoy of the 
then head of Hizbullah, Sheikh Abas Musawi, in South Lebanon. Musawi, his 
wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month later.

According to press reports, Mughniyeh was called back into action and, in a 
well-planned and devastating attack, his people blew up the Israeli embassy 
in Argentina. The building was demolished and 92 were killed. Only last 
year, after a long investigation, did Argentina issue a warrant for 
Mughniyeh's arrest. 

The reprisal for the attack in Argentina came in December 1994, when a car 
bomb went off in a southern Shi'ite suburb of Beirut. Four people were 
killed. One of them was called Mughniyeh, but to the deep disappointment of 
those Israelis who planted the bomb it was the wrong one. Mughniyeh's life 
was saved, but his other brother Fuad was killed. Mughniyeh waited for his 
opportunity for revenge. 

Our Israeli sources claim to see Mughniyeh's signature on the wreckage in 
New York and Washington. How to counter this kind of terrorism? "To fight 
these bastards you don't need a military attack," said an experienced 
Israeli commando officer. "You only need to adopt Israel's assassination 
policy."

Subject: What's the Plan -- Patterns of Global 
Terrorism 2000 


Hello friends, 

For those of you who I have not spoken to I hope with 
all my heart family and friends are safe.  The victims 
will not be forgotten.  

I would like to engage all of you in a discussion of 
what is to come.  Or perhaps I'm ranting you decide... 

My first reactions like many others were decimation, 
selected occupation, no more standing military, slowly 
over the course of 30-50 years we bring these nations 
into the fold of economic prosperity.  This has worked 
before, but will it now?  On terrorism and 
intelligence, I think terrorism is not to be treated 
as criminal law; we cannot follow the diplomatic code 
when dealing with terrorist organizations (i.e., our 
intelligence should be permitted to assassinate these 
people, or have moles on the payroll). 

After a few days of kill 'em all mentality, I decided 
to begin my education in this matter.  I would like to 
share with you my first research and some impressions. 
 I do feel more informed.  My resolve is no different; 
but my initial general blood thirst is evolving into 
something far more calculated. 

Domestic and international terrorism has been a 
horrible problem for as long as most nations can 
remember.  There is on average more than one terrorist 
event a day in the world.  In the late 1980's it was 
as high as 2 events a day. 
This is terrorism.  From Colin Powell himself.  I 
found myself numb before I event got through the first 
months of 2000.

List of major terrorist organizations - they will all 
need to be eliminated but I have highlighted the first 
targets. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000
<http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000>  
Start with Al Quida a focal point or umbrella 
organization for a worldwide network that includes 
many Sunni Islamic extremist groups such as Egyptian 
Islamic Jihad, some members of al-Gama'at 
al-Islamiyya, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and 
the Harakat ul-Mujahidin. 

Al-Qaida - an terrorist organization almost run by bin 
Laden, financially his network is like a holding 
company.  Al Quida exerts heavy influence over the 
four organizations listed below.  Each of the other 
organizations in turn exerts influence over other 
terrorist groups.  Most of these are fundamental 
Islamic extremist organizations.  A fear is that a 
general cohesive theme is to overthrow the 
middle-eastern governments, establish fundamentalist 
Islamic states which would persecute other religious 
observers within their borders, wage war on western 
influence internally,  and potentially engage in 
military actions against the United States and other 
western nations. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/qaida.htm
<http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/qaida.htm>  

These organizations have signed a fatwa issued by bin 
Laden in 1998 calling for the death of Americans.

Geography - very good idea to look at maps of the 
region. 
http://www.randmcnally.com <http://www.randmcnally.com>  
I found the geography interesting to study in detail. 
Afghanistan is horribly difficult to access.  The 
ocean-to-land access is through Pakistan's Arabian Sea 
coast; then head North 800 miles, to Peshawar and then 
into Kabul (the mountainous route the British used in 
1946).  The Pakistan army is 50% Taliban sympathetic. 
Already 42 political parties have issued statements of 
opposition to their own government for offering to 
help America.  They will descend into civil war most 
surely.  The HUM will likely be a significant part of 
that problem.  It will do us no good to partner with a 
cooperative government and an uncooperative military. 
Could American planes be shot down over Pakistan by 
renegades within their own army?  

Things we should know: 
In Pakistan, many Afghan refugees were initially 
trained by the US and Pakistan Intelligence (ISI) in 
the 1980's to fight the Soviets.  They were called the 
Mujahideen.  Many were children living in refugee 
camps when recruited, having known nothing else in 
this world.  Left to their own devices for 10 years, 
these camps and training centers have given root to 
terrorist organizations (HUM) and violently 
anti-humanitarian fundamentalist movements (the 
Taliban).  The Taliban gained control of Afghanistan 
in 1996 overthrowing the then Shiite-Communist regime, 
killing and hanging the president in downtown Kabul 
for several days.  The Taliban are Sunni Muslim 
fundamentalists and conduct a religious proletariat; 
they terrorize other Muslim communities, the Hazaras 
and Hindu Kush people within their borders.    The 
Taliban recently issued an edict requiring Afghan 
Hindus to wear identifications tags.  Sound familiar? 
The Taliban is hosting Al Qaida, bin Laden's 
organization.   bin Laden also influences the 
fundamentalist (IMU) in Uzbekistan.  The IMU is 
another Sunni fundamentalist terrorist group - they 
are mostly involved in terrorizing Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzistan, and Tajikistan, north of Afghanistan. 
The Taliban constituents are predominantly from the 
Pushtun region.  Pushtun covers parts of Afghanistan 
and Pakistan.; There have been movements to create a 
separate Pushtunistan.  This map indicates the ethnic 
breakdown in the region. 
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg>
. 
 And the HUM focuses their attacks on India. 

The Shi'ite Muslims, many other Sunni Muslims, and in 
general the world muslim community do not agree with 
the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law.  The 
Taliban is not accepted by most of the Islamic world 
because of their extreme harshness and treatment of 
women, total eliminations of all modern culture, and 
being the worlds largest heroin production.  The 
elimination of western influence is not considered a 
problem within some other fundamentalist groups. 

Afghanistan is not friendly with neighbor Iran to it's 
West.  Iran is an Shi'a or Shi'ite Muslim nation. 
Because Iran is predominantly Shi'a; they are 
unfriendly with the more radical Sunni dominated 
Afghanistan.  Iran backs the ousted government and is 
angered by Taliban terrorism and slaughtering of 
thousands of Shi'a Muslims, including Iranian 
diplomats in Afghanistan.  Iran also has border 
disputes with Iraq further to the West even after a 
devastating 8 year war.  Afghanistan and Iraq are both 
25 million people; Iran is closer to 65 million.

Also during the war with Soviet over 10 MILLION land 
mines were dropped in Afghanistan with no maps left 
behind.

<http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/>  

The only opposition to the Taliban is the Northern 
Military Alliance.  These people are also Sunni Muslim 
and ethnically are the Tajiks.  Their leader Massoud 
was killed last week, assassinated by men posing as 
the press.  The sliver of Afghanistan they still 
control is the finger squeezed between northern 
Pakistan and Southern Tajikistan and touching China. 
The Tajik presence cannot be eliminated by the Taliban 
without initiating conflict with Tajikistan.  The NMA 
is a political authority that may be put in place. 
They have offered 15000 soldiers, and 15000 more on 
reserve.  Their leader was killed last week, most 
likely in some coordinated effort - along with the new 
requirement that all organization in Afghanistan need 
to put monies in to the Afghan bank.  Many acts were 
clearly coordinated in this event. 

I have also been seeking out information on the 
Taliban in particular.  These link contain some very 
powerful information.  Quite frankly it is shameful 
that the Western world turned their back when this 
hellish situation was brought on upon Afghanistan many 
years ago. 

First a super high level overview - it is interesting 
to note how many times this land has been ravaged by 
invaders.

Try to digest this information - it is very important 
that initiate an informed dialogue.  But the Taliban 
must go. 

This section is organized geographically based on the 
waterways. 
The nations in question will need to eradicate, expel 
extremists from within their own borders.  This means 
partnering with a United States led coalition and 
contributing emphatically. 

Look at the Mediterranean coast. 
The South - Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Egypt are all 
plagued by terrorism. 
The East - Israel, Lebanon, Syria  all plagued by 
terrorist groups.  There is a dreadful rooting of 
terrorist organization.  Beirut was once a beautiful 
city I am told; For 20 years it has replaced Warsaw as 
the pop-culture reference to a war torn city. 
Terrorism surrounding Israel ties into several other 
organizations including Hizbollah and HAMAS. 

Look at the Red Sea. 
Egypt,Sudan and Saudi Arabia.  The Sudan is terribly 
infiltrated; this may be the terrorist plan hatching 
ground and safe haven.  And while the Saudi's are 
economically partnered with the western world, many 
extremists operating out of Saudi do fund these 
organizations.  Sudan is also suspected of being a 
meeting ground for the terrorist network.  

Look at the Gulf of Aden - entrance to the Red Sea 
Yemen - has allowed bin Laden to broadcast, site of 
the USS Cole bombing.  After the attack, the 
perpetrators fled from Yemen to Afghanistan. 

Rounding the corner into the Persian Gulf. 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - both 
acknowledge the Taliban government.  They have 
provided radical nationals to the Afghans, throughout 
the years, many support the Taliban; some trained with 
bin Laden.  We hope these governments have a change of 
heart with regard to recognition of the Taliban. 
Iran, Persia until 1935, has coastal territory along 
the gulf and the Caspian sea to the north.  We have 
had problems with Iran in the past; in the current 
situation, they may be helpful maybe not.  There is 
information pointing to an Islamic conference in 
Tehran which is another possible "hatching" ground for 
these operations.  Iran still may be a very serious 
issue in the future.  It is a religious government - 
something we all implicitly abhor in this nation. 
They exiled the Shah and began systematically 
eliminating western influence from their society after 
the event in 1979 
Iraq - Part of the Ottoman empire through 1932. 
Kurdish territory in the North bordering on Turkey. 
Hussein has used Sarin nerve gas against his own 
nationals, the Kurds in the North near the Turkish 
border.  As we know, he has invaded Kuwait.  An 8 year 
war with Iran over borders was going on at the same 
time the soviets were in Afghanistan.  This is a 
military regime.  Though the economic sanctions we 
have used for the last 10 years have kept Iraq down as 
military force; they have created a new generation of 
hatred. 

East from the Gulf into the Arabian Sea, part of the 
Indian Ocean, the Arabian basin is separated from the 
Indian Ocean by underwater land structure but there is 
nothing to prevent sea travel. 
Pakistan - a country on the verge of civil war.  A 
military regime. Probably half of the people in the 
army are Taliban sympathizers.  Pakistan may be in 
civil war shortly. 
India - the largest democracy in the world.  Still 
disassembling the 3500 yr old Caste System.  The 
British occupation left India with an intact system of 
representative government.  They are plagued by 
internal strife from the Sikh, who are separatists. 
Their brand of terrorism has been significantly 
reduced in the past 8 years.  They are also plagued by 
the HUM another extremist fundamental Islamic movement 
- very closely connected to the Taliban and bin Laden 
as described earlier. 

China actually shares a thin strip of border with 
Afghanistan near Tajikistan.  Pakistan also borders on 
China.  Though the Himalayas separate the bulk of this 
geographically from the 1 billion people of China. 
Having China on board is critical. 

I would like the US to investigate TSI, Telephone 
Services International, a New Jersey Corporation and 
Unocal, a California Oil Company.  Both of these 
companies have had business dealings with the Taliban 
government.  I believe that corporate greed with total 
disregard for the human condition in any country is 
unacceptable and should be uncovered and dealt with 
accordingly.  And I think the investment community 
needs to demonstrate in the markets to corporations 
who dabble in business with terror linked 
organizations.  The investment community was hit 
particularly hard; i hope going forward there will be 
a clear message to stop support for companies who may 
potentially aggravate terrorists to attack Americans. 
We may need to legally restrict what our corporations 
can do abroad and who they are allowed to strike deals 
with based on the opportunity cost of potential 
terrorist activity.  By all means, no corporation 
should have had any business dealings with the 
Taliban; perhaps this should be enforced by law. 

Some rants about waking the sleeping giant MIND! 
I firmly believe that the deadened state of 
intellectual discussion concerning these issues in 
America is part of the problem. 
We have been funneling our best minds into Technology, 
Banking, Law and Medicine for a very long time.  The 
general lack of information and interest in world 
political and human conditions, and the evolution of 
human governments is dangerous.  The average American 
simply need to be more informed and have an opinion to 
express to our government on what we can do to ensure 
the survival of our way of life and the spread of 
goodwill.  

Most likely we are all in agreement that a forceful 
military strike will initiate this new campaign;  I 
think there is quite a bit of confusion over what we 
really are about to embark on.  Our army may well 
include the corporate army and the casualties will be 
civilian.  We need to get every American to study this 
condition, it's roots, causes, directions and what we 
can do to end it.  Americans need to start an 
intelligent dialogue, around the country publicly so 
that we can demonstrate to ourselves and the rest of 
the world that we are educated and serious about 
achieving a solution.  Our military domination is 
already known throughout the world. 

Perhaps our long-term goal may involve bolstering the 
middle-class communities in these nations assuming 
they are moderate, tolerant and peace-loving; they 
need something to lose, and conversely, something to 
protect.  To get there we will need to eradicate any 
fundamentalist governments like the Taliban, under no 
circumstances can they be trusted going forward ever. 
We will need to partner with each nation and hunt the 
terrorist organizations down within their borders.  We 
need to seize assets, disable communications, engage 
in an unprecedented Intelligence campaign.   

Let's focus our efforts on thinking and providing our 
leadership with a collective strategy and wisdom, an 
opinion from within.  While I trust the powers that be 
to handle these affairs,  I never believed any day in 
my life that we were so vulnerable. 

Know the enemy. The threat of bio-chemical weapons - a 
simple overview of what the most likely agents are.

<http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/deadlygas0210.html>  

There is one company in America that is contracted by 
the DOD to produce the Anthrax vaccine, the BioPort 
Corporation, formerly known as the Michigan Biologic 
Products Institute (MBPI).  I hope the defense around 
that company is solid. 

Hopefully, this will generate some interest in 
developing a public discussion regarding strategies 
for the eradication of terrorism and governments that 
support them actively, tacitly or otherwise.  bin 
Laden  Imad Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas  

operations for Hizbullah, and the Egyptian Dr Ayman 

  Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible

and the Taliban should go first, then perhaps 
the other organizations mentioned above.  Then what 
Hussein, Qaddafi?  Will Egypt be on board when the Al 
Jihad unleash terror in Egypt?  Do these nations host 
silently in exchange for less or no terrorism within 
their borders, completely bending to the will of 
terrorists for fear of their people being injured?  Is 
that support or a successful campaign of terror? Where 
do we draw the line?  I suppose where you stand after 
Tuesday is a good start?  Who's next?  How do we 
prioritize? Will they are be lined up behind the US in 
1 year? 

Be strong,  Be prepared, Be smart, Be heard, God Bless 
America

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the "MBTI Work Styles"-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.Message-ID: <32745089.1075845251137.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

Dear Dr. Lockwood,

I had discussed with you an extension for RC502 and I would like to
propose finishing the course in January of 2002.   I am currently
enrolled in RC520 and will finish this course as per the regular
schedule.  The reason for my extension request is due to an unexpected
increase in workload from my current job, my desire to focus on the
Analytic methods course and my decision to apply to the DIA JMIC
Graduate training program (I wish to spend a good deal of time time on
the application).  Please let me know if this meets with your approval.

Sincerely,

Lawrence J. May

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check out.  

It's that easy!

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000Message-ID: <13050040.1075852959067.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm

No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.

Onsite Confidential Counseling / 24 Hour Hotline
EAP Counselors are available for individual, confidential appointments onsite in the Enron Building or at a variety of neighborhood locations.  Counselors are also available via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week for Enron employees in all locations.  The EAP counseling service is provided at no cost to employees and their family members.  To schedule an appointment or speak with a counselor, please call the onsite office at 713-853-6057 or the 24-hour number at 1-800-345-1391.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.Message-ID: <28312750.1075852957013.JavaMail.evans@thyme>
